## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All the necessary libraries used in this project are already available in the Anaconda distribution of Python.

This script was written using Python version 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project's goal is to recommend articles to IBM's platform users, considering Rank Based Recommendations, Collaborative Filtering, and Matrix Factorization.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. articles_community.csv: .csv file containing the different articles and its contents.
2. user-item-interactions.csv: .csv file registering the user-article interactions.
3. Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb: jupyter notebook presenting the recommendation solution.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

In this project, we were able to test different strategies to display a recommendation system. With the tested approaches, we could achieve at least 3 goals related to recommendation systems: *relevance*, *novelty*, and *diversity*.

One important aspect that was not achieved in this task is the *serendipity* that requires deeper analysis.
